Roll Runtime Estimator v0.0.1

User input:
    -Total number of rolls to run 
    -Sheets per hour
    -Starting sequence and ending sequence

Formula:
    Time for all rolls = ((((amount for 1 side across all ready rolls) / sheets per hour) * 60 ) * (roll change constant * number of rolls)) + (total number of gaps across all rolls * gap constant)

    
    Constant for roll change = 20 minutes
    Gap constant = 5 minutes
